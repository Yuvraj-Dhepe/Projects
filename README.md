# Data Science Portfolio 
This portfolio is a compilation of all Data Related Projects I have done for self-learning and hobby purposes. This portfolio also contains my skills, certs.

## Machine Learning Projects

The objective of this project was to come up with a solution for Rooftop Segmentation Problem, with limited dataset of 30 images and 30 labels. In this project I worked on 4 image segmentation models, 2 of which were trained from scratch (CNN, UNET) and rest 2 utilized the potential of Transfer Learning (Vgg16+Unet, MobileNetV2+Unet). The results were quite good ðŸ’« given the less data constraints of this project.

In this ML project I utilized the updated US Accidents dataset(2016-2023) consisting with more than 7 million accident records. The work included perform EDA on the dataset, cleaning the data, to make it suitable for classification, training and comparing various logistic regression algorithms like XGB, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regressor etc.

This project represents a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning workflow. It encompasses several stages, starting from the initial idea generation and progressing to the design and development of components and pipelines for data analysis, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) and training and comparing regression-based models. The final step involves deploying the model in a production environment on AWS for the purpose of learning. As a result, a fully functional [Gradio app](https://yuvidhepe-studentperformance.hf.space) has been created to enable user interaction, leveraging the capabilities of Hugging Face Spaces for hosting. However, due to cost constraints as a student, hosting the app indefinitely on AWS was not feasible. ðŸ˜Š
