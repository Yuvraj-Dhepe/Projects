# ISRO Career Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the path to joining the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) for students who have completed 10th grade from Maharashtra State Board and are pursuing Science stream in 11th & 12th grades.

## Career Path Visualization

The ISRO career path is visualized in a detailed flowchart that shows the journey from 10th grade completion to a career at the Indian Space Research Organisation. The diagram illustrates the four main phases:

1. **Foundation Phase** (11th & 12th Science with focus on PCM)
2. **Higher Education Phase** (Engineering/Science degrees and IIST direct entry)
3. **ISRO Entry Routes Phase** (Various recruitment processes)
4. **Career at ISRO Phase** (Different roles and career progression)

The diagram is color-coded to distinguish between different career tracks:
- Scientist/Engineer track (blue)
- Technical Assistant track (green)
- Technician track (yellow)
