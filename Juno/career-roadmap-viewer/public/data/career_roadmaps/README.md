The diagrams are stored in separate `.mmd` files in the `diagrams` folder of each career path, making them easy to view, edit, or export as needed. This separation allows for better organization and easier maintenance of the visual content.

### Rendered Diagrams

All diagrams have been pre-rendered in both PNG and SVG formats for easy viewing and sharing. You can find these rendered diagrams in the `rendered_diagrams` folder. Each career path README includes direct links to its rendered diagrams.

### Rendering Your Own Diagrams

If you want to customize or re-render the diagrams, you can use the provided scripts:

1. `render_all_diagrams.sh` - Renders all diagrams in both PNG and SVG formats
2. `update_readme_links.sh` - Updates all README files with links to the rendered diagrams

These diagrams make it easy to understand the complete career path at a glance and help students make informed decisions about their future.
