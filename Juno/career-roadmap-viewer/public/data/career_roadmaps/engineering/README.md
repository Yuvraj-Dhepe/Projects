# Engineering Career Roadmap via Maharashtra CET

This roadmap outlines the path to becoming an engineer through the Maharashtra Common Entrance Test (MHT-CET) route for students who have completed 10th grade from Maharashtra State Board and are pursuing Science stream in 11th & 12th grades.

## Career Path Visualization

The engineering career path is visualized in a detailed flowchart that shows the journey from 10th grade completion to becoming an employed engineer. The diagram illustrates the four main phases:

1. **Preparation Phase** (11th & 12th Science)
2. **Entrance & Admission Phase** (MHT-CET and college admission)
3. **Engineering Degree Phase** (4-year B.Tech/B.E. program)
4. **Career Options Phase** (Various paths after graduation)
