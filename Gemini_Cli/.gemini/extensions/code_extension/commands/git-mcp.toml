prompt = """
You are setting up an MCP server for a GitHub repository provided by the user.

User input: {{args}}

### Steps:
1. Extract `{owner}` and `{repo}` from the GitHub URL (example: https://github.com/owner/repo).
2. Build the MCP URL: `https://gitmcp.io/{owner}/{repo}`.
3. Update the `gemini-extension.json` file for the `gitmcp` extension to include:
   ```json
   "mcpServers": {
       "gitmcp": {
           "url": "https://gitmcp.io/{owner}/{repo}",
           "disabled": false,
           "autoApprove": []
       }
   }
    ````
4. Use the `write_file` tool to update the extension file at `~/.gemini/extensions/gitmcp/gemini-extension.json`.
5. Do not overwrite other keys in the JSON; merge intelligently.
